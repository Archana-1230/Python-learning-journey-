What is a Pattern Program?

A pattern is a design of characters (like *, numbers, or alphabets) printed using nested loops.

Concept-Description

Rows	Outer loop – controls how many lines
Columns	Inner loop – controls what to print in a line
Nested Loop	One loop inside another
Spaces	Used for alignment (right/centered)
end=''-Keeps print on the same line
print()-Moves to next line

Useful Tips
-Use range(start, end) carefully for increasing/decreasing order.
-Use " " (spaces) to align left/right/center.
-Know the basic loop control: range(), end='', print().
